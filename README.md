4.4BSD
------

The best way to learn is by typing out all the examples yourself. That's all
this is. Attempting (and probably failing) to learn something about BSD
sockets via [An Introductory 4.4BSD Interprocess Communication
Tutorial](http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/20.ipctut/paper.pdf).

Mainly on GitHub as a backup.
